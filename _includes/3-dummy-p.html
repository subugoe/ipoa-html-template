<p>So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past? I'm a 32 year old IT-man who works in a basement. Yes, I do the whole Lonely Hearts thing! Yes! If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them. Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I dont care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs!</p>
<p>You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them! Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments.</p>

If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them. You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality. Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I dont care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs!
